COBOL Examples readme

This is for my COBOL samples.

There are two programs.

The first is a simple FizzBuzz program.
For FizzBuzz, the program counts from 1..100, printing Fizz if the number is divisble by three, and Buzz if the number is divisble by 5.

The second is a generic loan program you can find just about anywhere.
Given some data, it computes both the payment amout for a loan, as well as the present value of the loan.
